# PyCaret for Machine Learning

PyCaret is a comprehensive tool that simplifies the process of deploying machine learning models. It supports multiple machine learning algorithms and allows users to compare them with just three lines of code. PyCaret is available for various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering.

## In this tutorial, we will learn:

1. **Getting Data**: How to import data from the PyCaret repository.
2. **Setting up Environment**: How to set up an experiment in PyCaret and get started with building regression, classification, and clustering models.
3. **Create Model**: How to create a model, perform cross-validation, and evaluate regression metrics.
4. **Tune Model**: How to automatically tune the hyperparameters of a regression model.
5. **Plot Model**: How to analyze model performance using various plots.
6. **Finalize Model**: How to finalize the best model at the end of the experiment.
7. **Predict Model**: How to make predictions on new or unseen data.
8. **Save / Load Model**: How to save or load a model for future use.

## Example: Three Lines of Code for Model Comparison using the "Insurance" Dataset

```python
from pycaret.datasets import get_data
from pycaret.regression import *

insuranceDataSet = get_data("insurance")
s = setup(data=insuranceDataSet, target='charges', silent=True)
cm = compare_models()
